# Random_Data_Creation
These Python scripts generate random barcodes for different product categories, such as women’s and men’s shoes, home products, and children’s clothing. They also generate customer IDs and order numbers. Each script produces 100 barcodes and prints them to the console by combining fixed and variable parts for each category.

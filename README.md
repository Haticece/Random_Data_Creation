# Barcode Generator Scripts

This repository contains several Python scripts that generate random barcodes for different product categories. Each script is designed to generate barcodes for a specific type of product, such as men's shoes, women's shoes, children's clothing, etc.

## Overview

The barcodes are generated by combining fixed and variable parts, where the variable parts include product codes, reference codes, color codes, size codes, and last digits. The fixed parts are constant for each product category.
